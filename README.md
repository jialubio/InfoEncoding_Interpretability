# InfoEncoding_interpretability

Biological patterns, such as colony morphology, can be used to [encode real-world information](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100590). A machine learning-based decoder has been built to extract the common features from morphologies from different classes of images. To better understand what are the key features the ML model recognized, interpretability algorithms are applied, such as saliency map.
